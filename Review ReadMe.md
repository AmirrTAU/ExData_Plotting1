NOTE regarding the way I structured my submission: It has an additional script file which contains everything except the plot codes. 

Instructions for following my solution:

1. download the file containing the data ("household....txt")
2. run preparation and run.r e.g. source('~/R/ExData_Plotting1/preparation and run.r')
3. observe the 4 new png files (e.g. "plot1.png")
4. individual plot scripts are in similary named files (e.g. "plot1.r")

Thanks for reviewing !
